# Title: Analyzing Country Data using Pandas

## Overview:

The assignment involved importing, cleaning, analyzing and merging two CSV datasets containing country-level data like population, GDP, life expectancy along with COVID-19 statistics.
Key Tasks:

Read CSV files into Pandas dataframes

Analyzed and filtered data based on conditions

Performed aggregations like sum, mean, count on columns

Added new columns using existing data

Sorted and retrieved top/bottom rows based on column values

Merged the two datasets into a combined dataframe

Computed per capita COVID-19 metrics like cases per million

Identified countries with highest/lowest metrics using sorting

## Key Findings:

The global population based on the dataset is around 7.8 billion

Weighted average global life expectancy is 72.7 years

10 most populous countries are China, India, USA, Indonesia, Pakistan etc.

Peru, Belgium, Italy have the highest COVID deaths per million people

Qatar, Bahrain, Panama have the highest cases per million

## Conclusion:

Pandas provided effective data manipulation capabilities to wrangle, analyze and visualize country data

Useful insights were obtained into country-level metrics and trends

Further analysis could focus more on time-series COVID data
